    redirect to after login.

    """Middleware to better integrate the email authentication backend into
    the admin site. The default staff_member_required decorator used to protect
    admin pages provides its own login form. This gives misleading error
    messages (for example, 'Usernames may not contain @'). Also, if a user is
    inactive or doesn't have staff status, it keeps prompting them to login
    rather than telling them what the real issue is.

    This middleware replaces the default decorator with a custom version which
    redirects to the LOGIN_URL specified in the settings when needed. It also
    tells the user if they don't have staff status so they know what the issue
    is.

    To ensure this substitution occurs on every request, it is recommended this
    middleware is placed at the top of the list. It never stops a request and
    so will not interfere with other middleware.
